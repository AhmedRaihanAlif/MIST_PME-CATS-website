            <ul>
                <li>Through physical testing, the presence of
				contaminants such as fuel or water in engine oil,
				as well as cross-contamination of lubricants,
				can be detected.</li>
                <li>The cleanliness of oils can be assessed
				according to standardized measurements</li>
                <li>The condition of the oil can be assessed to
				enable cost-effective measures such as topping
				up the oil when needed, instead of performing
				unnecessary oil changes. Thereby optimizing
				maintenance costs.</li>
                <li>Analyzing the oil allows for verification of the correct type and grade being used, ensuring
				that the oil meets the specific requirements of
				the equipment.</li>
                <li>Analysis confirms the presence of appropriate
				additives, which are crucial for optimal
				performance and protection of the equipment</li>
